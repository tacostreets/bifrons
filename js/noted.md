# wizard101

# wizard101 is the heading
the number of the # is the number of the headings
e.g. ## is heading 2 #### is heading 4

we are working on the pseudo code
the basic thing that happens is an infinite loop
the player gives a command and the game responds

everything else is 
the data that the game has to remember 
What the game needs to do with the data that needs to remember

in javascript we will use a form for the user to enter information

a form gives you input fields for the user to fill out.
you have fields, radio buttons, check boxes etc.
the browser understands those and and knows what's in the form the server does not
so the browser packages those answers up and sends it to the server.  using GET or POST
The servers perspective is it receives a GET or POST request which is parses

The form is not the GET or POST request. The form is just an HTML page that allows the browser to create a GET or POST request. 

We will have a server and a web page
the web page will have a form for the user to type commands
the server will have a response that it will print out onto the page. 

We will start with a single page static javascript code to keep it simple to start with then move on to the API server

The information that needs to be saved for the game will be stored in the browser and can only be retrieved from the same browser you previously played on. 
There are a few ways for browsers to store data e.g. 
cookies(remembers who you are),  
local data(remembers everything), 
session data(used for authentication), 
indexedDB(advanced remember)
